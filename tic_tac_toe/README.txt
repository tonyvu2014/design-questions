# Problem

Design a Tic Tac Toe game.


# Analysis

This question is a very good candidate to test how well we can come up with a object-oriented design for a popular game. 
There are likely only a few objects and minimal interaction so it is well-suited for a 30 to 1 hour interview.

1. Questions to ask

The problem statement is very short so depending if you know the game or not, you can ask several questions to understand 
more about the requirements. For example, you can ask:

- What are the size of the board? Is it 3x3 or nxn?
- What are the rules to decide the winner?

2. Entities

Try to map from the real objects related to the game to the entities. On minimal, we can come up with the following classes:

- Cell (represent a cell on the board)
- Board (represents a tic tac toe board)
- Player (obviously represents a player)
- Game (represents a game)
