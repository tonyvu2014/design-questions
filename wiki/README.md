# Problem

Design a wiki-like system.

# Analysis

The problem statement is very brief and generic so you should definitely ask questions to narrow down the constraints. This question is not only to test your object-oriented design skill but likely to test your system design knowledge to handle large-scale distributed system. 

1. Questions to ask

- What are the use cases? Add/view/edit/remove a post? Search for contents? View history of edit? Tagging of the post?
- Who are the users? Admin, contributors, viewers?
- What media types do we support? Plain text, images, videos?
- How many users do we support?

2. Entities

3. Scaling
